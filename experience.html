            <p>
                I worked in software branch located in Izmir called <a href="https://www.creaware.net/"
                    target="_blank"><b>creaware.</a></b>
                During my time in creaunion I have worked on projects like onPartner and onPlus. Cakephp, Docker and
                nginx was utilized in
                these projects. I have worked in creaunion for 1.5 years. I have improved my <b>problem solving</b> and
                <b>project
                    management</b> skills greatly during my time here.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had experiences with creating payment systems via
                Stripe, managing databases, solving critical live bugs with haste, designing good UI elements and
                combining them with great user experience and, many more.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have started as a junior fullstack developer
                in creaunion and, within months I was the lead developer for onPlus. During this transition I have
                learned what makes a team great. I had chances to make important decisions which helped me improve my
                <b>decision making</b> and <b>resource management</b> skills.
