            <p>After I graduated from Istanbul Bilgi University in February of 2022, I worked and saved money to
                further my education in Europe. Eventually, I decided that UE would be a great choice for me. Starting
                from September of 2024, I have enrolled in a 1 year <b>Master of Software Engineering</b> program.</p>

            <p>I started my higher education as Mechatronics Engineer on September 2017 at Bilgi University with full
                scholarship. During my education I realized, <b>I love developing software</b> more than mechatronics.
                After this realization I started spending most of my free time learning more and more coding. I picked
                every elective software course I can and spent my nights watching tutorials, reading documents and
                developing small projects.</p>
            <p>I graduated in February of 2022 but never stopped learning.</p>

            <p>Few weeks after graduating I knew I still had a lot to learn. While browsing the internet I came across a
                <b>.NET Backend Bootcamp</b>. I was immediately interested. After successfully passing their exam I was
                enrolled for one month bootcamp.
            </p>
            <p>I have learned important fundamentals of backend design in this bootcamp. I have successfully finished
                this bootcamp with my final project ranking as second best project in 20 projects</p>
