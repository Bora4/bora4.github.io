            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My favorite part of being a software developer designing and creating. I love designing
                systems and creating good user experiences. I love designing neat and understandable structures, I
                always write code with the goal of it being understandable by other developers. Another goal of mine is
                to create structures that are modular, making it easy to modify or compeletly change without breaking
                the entire structure.

                    It goes without saying that I am proficient in HTML and CSS but, I can't call myself a CSS expert. I
                    enjoy working with Bootstrap. I also have experience with Material Design.

                <h4>PHP</h4>
                <p>
                    PHP is the language that I have the most professional experience with but I can't say it is my
                    favorite
                    language. During my time in <a href="/experience.html"> creaunion </a> we used CakePHP in the
                    projects. CakePHP is a MVC framework. <!-- TODO: redirect creaunion to its own section-->
                    I have intermediate experience in PHP.

                <p>
                    Everyone who is into web development must know some basic JavaScript. Working on projects
                    throughout
                    the years, I have learned the importance and the strength of JavaScript. I have written many scripts
                    with
                    JavaScript from simple form submission to video tracking. I know how to work with XHR, Ajax and
                    jquery.
                    I can install libraries to projects with CDN or by including min.js locally.

                    <h5>TypeScript</h5>
                    <p>
                        TypeScript is one of my favorite languages. I prefer creating backend structures with
                        technologies
                        that do type checking, this is actually one of the reasons PHP is not my favorite language. I do
                        not
                        have professional experience with TypeScript but I have participated in <a
                            href="https://github.com/UnoDosTres2/jaeger" target="_blank" class="more-info">this
                            project</a> where we
                        created
                        a
                        TypeScript app from scratch. Another example is the <a href="https://github.com/Bora4/senior"
                            target="_blank" class="more-info">project</a> I made in my senior year in university for
                        scanning books automatically and sending them via email in PDF format. There
                        is also <a href="https://github.com/Bora4/footnotes" target="_blank" class="more-info">this
                            project</a> that I started that is still in a very early stage.

                    <p>
                        I am very eager to learn more TypeScript.
